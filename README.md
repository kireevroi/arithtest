## Description
A simple problem solving trainer for console use.


## Dependencies
PY2EXE and DISTUTILS REQUIRED TO GET EXE FILE using py2exe

## Changelog
06.02.2021// Added result database. Not integrated yet.
Comments need to be translated

30.11.2021// Integrated result database to main.py via dbinteraction.py
Base functionality still works.
Comments are translated.
Added names and score scaling depending on complexity.
Need to move the calculation to another file for readability.

30.11.2021-2// Added setup.py to form an installer via py2exe and distutils
I still reccomend using pyinstaller as it is alot easier and allows you to get
a single exe file.
